# Campus Population Database Application
This is a **Campus Population Database Application**, a streamlined example 
showcasing a RESTful API seamlessly integrated with a backend **MongoDB** database.

The application is designed in a component driven format and is split into two main components, 
**Users** and **Assignments**. The index.js files within these two directories house the models, 
controllers, and routes for the entire application.

Each component is paired with its own test file to seamlessly test the functionality
of the application.
